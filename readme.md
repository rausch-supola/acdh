# Welcome to my submission
This repository contains the code for the Assessment Task "Data Extraction from XML".  
I hope you will enjoy the content.  

Sincerely,  
Michaela Rausch-Supola

## Setup dependencies
- Java 17 - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows  
- BaseX 10.7 - https://basex.org/download/

## Usage
- Copy the WIBARAB data into a folder named features inside the main folder, or adjust the path of the features in the code (line 12)
- Copy the file for the bibliographic data and the geodata into a folder named references inside the main folder, or adjust the path of the references in the code (line 14 and 15)    
- Adjust your folder path for the output XML file (line 10)

## Additional information
- No task-relevant documents were found to be ill-formed
- No broken pointers were discovered in the process of task assignment

### Applied approach
- I used XQuery for the data extraction, as this solution seemed the most appropriate for the job-role 
- The report has been created in XML format because of the same reason as above
